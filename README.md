# CS Theory Papers Model

**Author:** Abhinav Madahar <abhinavmadahar@gmail.com>

This is a machine learning model which generates paper abstracts in the theory subfield of computer science.
I can't find a dataset of CS theory papers, but I can make a dataset of those papers' abstracts.

## Todo

The todo is expected to get more sub-tasks as the project continues.

- [ ] Get dataset of paper abstracts in CS theory
- [ ] Select a model architecture to use
- [ ] Implement the model
- [ ] Fine-tune the model
- [ ] Publish results

## Model design

The model is a text generation model.
It takes no inputs and generates a paper in CS theory as the output.
The output text has no formatting, consisting solely of raw text.
